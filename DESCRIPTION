Description: GWES-Explorer is an interactive visualization tool designed to be used in conjunction
    with SpydrPick (see https://github.com/santeripuranen/SpydrPick). GWES-Explorer relies heavily
    on the Shiny and Vega libraries to deploy it as a web application with multiple plot types
    to visualize the genomic data. GWES-Explorer operates on the outliers file generated by SpydrPick
    to produce a GWES Manhattan plot. Two additional plots can be generated, namely a phylogenetic
    tree plot by providing either a Newick or a Nexus file in addition to a FASTA and a loci file,
    and a highly interactive circular chromosome plot by providing a GFF3 file.
