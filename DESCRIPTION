Description: GWESalyzer is an interactive visualization tool designed to be used in conjunction
    with SpydrPick (see https://github.com/santeripuranen/SpydrPick). GWESalyzer heavily relies
    on the Shiny and Vega libraries to deploy it as a web application with multiple plot types
    to visualize the genomic data. GWESalyzer operates on the outliers file generated by SpydrPick
    together with the FASTA and loci files to produce a GWES Manhattan plot. Two additional plots
    can be generated, namely a phylogenetic tree plot by providing either a Newick or a Nexus file,
    and a highly interactive circular chromosome plot by providing a GFF3 file.
